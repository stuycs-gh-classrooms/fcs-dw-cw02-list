### Getting Started

In this repository you will find this file and a file called _list\_fun.rkt_.
- README.md (the file you are currently reading) contains all the instructions for this assignment.
- You will also put all your answers in this file (instead of the racket file).
- list\_fun.rkt is a racket file containing sample code and some instructions. The questions you have to answer will be based on the contents of this file.
- Copy the contents of list\_fun.rkt into DrRacket, run the code, then reach the questions below and answer them.
- If the questions ask you to write some racket code, put the code inside \` \` marks (you'll see examples of this in the file as well.)
- When you are asked to write code, test it out in Dr Racket.
